Girl, you jump me, said ain't got a type
Zip lock right now
Will you love me when I'm afraid of flight?
Can't think right now
I can't lie, on my mind
I feel right, I feel right
I can't lie, on my mind
I feel right
I don't wanna wait forever now, L.A.
I don't wanna live like that no more, L.A.
Only when we sleep
The promise that you'll keep
And you will never win
Until you feel me breathe
Say you're done, you were right all my life
Fallen for your red eyes (red eyes)
Both dying right now (right now, right now)
Got me back on my old life
You're not my young
You're not mine
You're not mine
You're not cool
You're not fine
I last lied
They ask why?
I'm begging time (I'm begging time)
I don't wanna wait forever now, L.A.
I don't wanna live like that no more, L.A.
Only when we say sleep
The promise that you'll keep
When you will never win
Until you feel me breathe
Say you're done, you were right all my life
