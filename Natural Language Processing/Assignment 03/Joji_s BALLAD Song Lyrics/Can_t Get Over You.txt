I can't get over you
Can't get over you
And before I die I pray that
I could be the one
That I could be the one
But I won't be no fun
If I can't have you no one can
Balance in the limelight
Can you show me
To the day life
Baby, I like more curves like
But I want you, and alright (you're alright)
Tell me more, I got a box cutter with your name on it
Tell me more, I can't stay this long on the same topic
Don't know you, why would I fall in love with you?
I don't have no social cues
I'm all for you
Ay (ha, ha, ha)
I can't get over you (yeah, ooo)
Can't get over you (yeah, ooo)
And before I die I pray that
I could be the one
That I could be the one
But I won't be no fun
If I can't have you no one can
