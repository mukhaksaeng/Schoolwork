Won't you come through? I don't know me
You could walk right through
There's nothing like me, you know
No caller ID, you know
You don't really like me, you know
And I don't really like me, you go
Boy, you're better by default
No, red rocks so bright (So bright)
You've been open your eyes
Hell all rise
Make you so blind (So blind)
With a thousand tiddies, you call me right in
But entirely, I wish you look like heaven
But entirely, I'm knocking my neck until it break
If I lived too long you kill me with a stick
No mistake, no mistake, no mistake
The reflection never point the same way
ABBA on repeat, yeah
Diamond like a dancing queen
So
Won't you come through? I don't know me
You could walk right through
There's nothing like me, you know
No caller ID, you know
You don't really like me, you know
And I don't really like me, you go
Boy, you're better by default
Won't you come through? I don't know me
You could walk right through
And there's nothing like me, you know
No caller ID, you know
You don't really like me, you know
And I don't really like me, you go
Boy, you're better by default
