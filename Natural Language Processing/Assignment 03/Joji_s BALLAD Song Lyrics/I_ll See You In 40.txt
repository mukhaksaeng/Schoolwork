Please don't come around
Please don't come around
Please don't come around
Please don't, please don't
I was trying to
It's alright (It's alright)
It's alright (It's alright)
If you would turn me to
Forever will be nice (Will be nice)
Will be nice (Will be nice)
Why are you doing to take that way
I don't understand (I don't understand)
I could name a thousand different reasons you could find
Oh you mind, I'm alright
I could feel the change (The change)
The way you sing your song (The way you sing your song)
I could feel the ways (I could feel the ways)
You sang from kingdom soul (You sang from kingdom soul)
