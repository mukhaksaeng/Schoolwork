I don't really wanna run around, yeah
Time is going slow and I don't mind, yeah
Tell me if you know I'm really found, yeah
Fuck around a bit and get it right
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't really wanna run around
Round, round, round, round, round, round, round, round
Saying all the words and make the world go
Round, round, round, round, round, round, round, round
Round, round, round, round
Round, round, round, round
Round, round, round, round
Round, round, round, round
Keep your pass another my way (My way)
Another night, a lot more days (More days)
Hard to think about you anymore ('Bout you anymore)
But I keep you in my mind always (Always)
Called me on the phone last night (Last night)
Couldn't hear your voice top flight (Top flight)
I won't be around you anymore (Around you anymore)
In a dream where you feel alone
I don't really wanna run around, yeah
Time is going slow and I don't mind, yeah
Tell me if you know I'm really found, yeah
Fuck around and didn't get it right
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I don't really wanna run around
Round, round, round, round, round, round, round, round
Saying all the words and make the world go
Round, round, round, round, round, round, round, round
Girl, why don't you just stay?
Tellin' me that you're okay
Just better if you stay away
Better if you stay away
And stay away
Stay away, stay away
Alright
