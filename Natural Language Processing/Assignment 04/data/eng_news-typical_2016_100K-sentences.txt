2628	And every audience is different.
2629	And everybody else paid.
2630	And everybody helps everybody.
2631	And every light deserves a dimmer.
2632	And everyone gets a trophy!
2633	And everyone has a story.
2634	And everyone is happy.
2635	And everyone knows everyone.
2636	And everyone was smiling.
2637	And every situation is different.
2638	And everything in its place.
2639	And everything is so expensive!
2640	And few selfies were shot.
2641	And finally he was gone.
2642	And finally there’s the question of defense.
2643	And finally, we tasted it.
2644	And find them we did.
2645	And food is a real standout.
2646	And for the same money.
2647	And for what purpose.
2648	And fry bread doesn’t help.
2649	And fuck this process.
2650	And Genoways published his own book?
2651	And get that support back.
2652	And getting a job.
2653	And girls are not immune.
2654	And give back they did.
2655	And good luck with it.
2656	And government expectations are high.
2657	And gun ownership as a privilege?
2658	And have a great night.
2659	And he achieved that goal.
2660	And healthcare is always changing.
2661	And he always smiles.
2662	And he bought a gun.
2663	And he certainly deserved it.
2664	And he chose game shows.
2665	And he did a really good job.
2666	And he did it with a vengeance.
2667	And he didn’t direct me.
2668	And he didn't give himself that title.
2669	And he didn't seem too concerned.
2670	And he didn’t win.”
2671	And he did--until now.
2672	And he disappointed us.
2673	And he even admits so.
2674	And he gives a 15-minute statement.
2675	And he got mad.
2676	And he got off easy.
2677	And he had high goals.
2678	And he has allies.
2679	And he has no political vision.
2680	And he has said a lot.
2681	And he is a genuinely nice person.
2682	And he is also useful on the deck.
2683	And he is always well prepared.
2684	And he is quite correct.
2685	And he is right!
2686	And he joins us now.
2687	And he just about died.
2688	And he kept making it.
2689	And he killed a pizza-delivery guy.
2690	And he knew it.
2691	And he knows his food!
2692	And he liked her a whole lot.
2693	And he lived to tell the story.
2694	And he loved to help people.
2695	And he meant it.
2696	And he never met a stranger.
2697	And he put our float together.
2698	And he rarely played favorites.
2699	And her breasts.
2700	And her dancing is superb.
2701	And here is another bummer.
2702	And here is the big picture.
2703	And here's a third question.
2704	And here’s a warning from the auxiliary.
2705	And here's our assessment.
2706	And here's the problem.
2707	And here’s the real surprise.
2708	And her ethics are clearly sleazy.
2709	And her imagery is sumptuous.
2710	And her truth-telling can be powerful.
2711	And he's always working hard.
2712	And he’s doing just that.
2713	And he's got a plan.
2714	And he's not alone in Europe.
2715	And he's note perfect.
2716	And he's not funny, either.
2717	And he’s sure about it.
2718	And he sticks by that statement.
2719	And he still does.
2720	And he tried to do it.
2721	And he used it.
2722	And he usually doesn’t fumble.
2723	And he wants some company.
2724	And he wants the nuclear codes.
2725	“And he was completely right.
2726	And he was dying.
2727	And he was innocent.
2728	And he wasn't moving.
2729	"And he was patient.
2730	And he was pretty fast.
2731	And he was right."
2732	And he was sensational.
2733	And he was shot in the head.
2734	And he was speechless.
2735	And he was the caretaker.
2736	And he will take his own time.
2737	And he won the cold war.
2738	And Hillary knows it.
2739	And his concerns are valid.
2740	And his expectations were not unfounded.
2741	And his fat tutor?
2742	And his pet peeves?
2743	And his verbiage is so colourful.
2744	And his verdict was surprisingly harsh.
2745	And how about that peripatetic Noel?
2746	And how could I not?
2747	And how did he lose?
2748	And how do we create the ripple?
2749	And how do you follow that?
2750	And how will you know that?
2751	And I always say that.
2752	And I am really cheap.
2753	And I appreciate the effort.
2754	And I asked for this assignment.
2755	And I chose nothing.
2756	And I completely get it.
2757	And I could feel it."
2758	And I could never shoot a deer.
2759	And I didn’t pay rent.
2760	And I didn't plan to.
2761	And I'd never met his wife.
2762	… And I don’t either.
2763	And I don’t even have a dog.
2764	And I don’t even like Hillary.
2765	And I don’t have answers.
2766	And I enjoyed the taste.
2767	And I find them.
2768	And if the Convention..
2769	And I got into a bidding war.
2770	“And I had no gray hair.
2771	And I have a show!
2772	And I have no insurance.
2773	And I have the experience.
2774	And I have to try.
2775	And I identified with her.
2776	And I just clipped him.
2777	And I just don’t get it.
2778	And I liked the stories.
2779	And I like my job.
2780	And I like the sound.
2781	And I'll buy it.
2782	And I'll raise you a forehead.
2783	And I love art.
2784	And I love this.
2785	And I love this house.
2786	And I love this land.
2787	And I made the flight.
2788	And I’m a trusting guy.
2789	And I may not do it again.
2790	And I’m deeply loved.
2791	And I mean millions.
2792	And I'm for Denver.
2793	And I miss them very much.
2794	And I'm just smiling.
2795	And I’m nervous.
2796	And I'm not exaggerating.
2797	And I'm really happy about that.
2798	And I'm still here.
2799	And I'm still not sorry.
2800	And I’m tired of it.
2801	And, incredibly, it worked.
2802	And indeed she does.
2803	And indeed, the next generation.
2804	And indulge we did!
2805	And I need those instructions!
2806	And I never saw it.
2807	And in the long term?
2808	And in this particular order.
2809	And into state capitals.
2810	And I paid dearly for it.
2811	And I plan to continue these habits.
2812	And I really appreciated that.
2813	And I really hate that.
2814	“And I said no garnet!
2815	And I seem to remember a cheap suit.
2816	And I see no end in sight.
2817	Andi Shahu is a medical student at the Yale School of Medicine.
2818	And I should dress like a citizen?
2819	And Israel is always wrong.
2820	And is she a victim?
2821	And I started to remember.
2822	And I still do now.
2823	“And I stopped them.
2824	And it all comes back.
2825	And it also happened in January.
2826	And it also makes practical sense.
2827	And it always requires explanation.
2828	And it bothers me.
2829	And it breaks my heart.
2830	And it can be a maze.
2831	And it can be rewarding.
2832	And it cannot be bought.
2833	And it changed his entire outlook.
2834	And it changed right up front.
2835	And it changes the focus.
2836	And it continues on.
2837	And it could be lethal.
2838	And it did become a supper.
2839	And it did hurt.
2840	And it didn't, gratefully.
2841	And it didn't work very well.
2842	And it doesn’t have to remain this way.
2843	And it don't exist.
2844	And it felt SO GOOD!
2845	And it gets yet worse.
2846	And it goes on!
2847	And it had the same result.
2848	And it has improved.
2849	And I think it is.
2850	And I think it should.
2851	And I think it's inappropriate.
2852	And I think it’s totally valid.
2853	And I think that’s a fantastic ambition.
2854	And I think that's an important transition.
2855	And I think that's a valid perception.
2856	And I think that’s difficult.”
2857	And I think that’s good.
2858	And I think this is a great idea.
2859	And it inspired our band.
2860	And it is a death.
2861	And it is almost new.
2862	And it is always shouted.
2863	And it is free money.
2864	And it is happening today.
2865	And it is highly disturbing.
2866	And it is not a television broadcast.
2867	And it is not over.
2868	And it is not too much.
2869	And it isn't easy.
2870	And it isn't too tart.
2871	And it is potentially dangerous.
2872	And it is too much.
2873	And it is unlikely the full story.
2874	And it just got better.
2875	And it just touched me.
2876	And it makes me sick.
2877	And it might not be close.
2878	And it must be American.
2879	And it nagged me.
2880	And it needs a new generation.
2881	And it often provides a natural high.
2882	And I told them off.
2883	And it opens early—at 5.am.
2884	And it rarely creates prosperity.
2885	And it really didn’t.
2886	And it requires compromise.
2887	"And it's absolutely riveting.
2888	And it’s a close-knit community.
2889	And it's a compelling tale, indeed.
2890	“And it’s a fun group.
2891	And, it's a good idea.
2892	And it’s a great community.
2893	And it’s a huge crowd.
2894	And it's all about prudence.
2895	And it’s all documented.
2896	“And it’s already a hard number.
2897	And it’s also graduation tonight.
2898	And it's also not Tim Wakefield.
2899	And it’s a network for a lifetime.
2900	And it’s an excellent ride.
2901	“And it’s a nice feeling.
2902	And it's a process."
2903	And it’s a tall order, indeed.
2904	And it's a true story!
2905	And it's a very gentle heat.
2906	And it's certainly working.
2907	And it's classic.
2908	And it’s completely deserved.
2909	And it’s definitely a contemporary adaptation.
2910	And it's easy to digest.
2911	And it’s easy to install.
2912	“And it’s energy.
2913	And it’s for an amazing cause.
2914	And, it's free.
2915	And it's fresh!
2916	And it's getting pricier.
2917	And it’s happening again.
2918	And it's hard work.
2919	And it’s hitting home.
2920	And it should continue.
2921	And it should stay that way.”
2922	And it's how I react.
2923	“And it’s huge.
2924	And it's illustrated with cartoons.
2925	… And it’s intense.
2926	And it's just a good town."
2927	And it’s just as outrageous as it sounds.
2928	And it's just not me.
2929	And it’s just this guy there.
2930	And it’s kind of infinite.
2931	And it’s more than that.
2932	And it’s no different in Japan.
2933	And it's not a good ad.
2934	And it’s not a good plan.
2935	"And it's not a threat.
2936	And it’s not a vegetable.
2937	And it's not even from The Onion.
2938	And it's not for money.
2939	And it’s not from another planet.
2940	And it's not going to work.
2941	And it's not just a little splash.
2942	And it's not just any video.
2943	And it’s not just as an actor.

2952	And it's pretty awesome.
2953	And it’s pretty commonplace.
2954	And it’s pretty darn good.
2955	And it's pretty popular, too.
2956	And it's quite good.
2957	“And it’s small mesh.
2958	And it’s so good!”
2959	And it's so much fun!
2960	And it’s so sad.”
2961	And it’s still above the national average.
2962	"And it’s still a great workout.
2963	And it starts with your plate.
2964	And it’s the same story inside.
2965	And it still wasn’t enough.
2966	And it’s true to form.
2967	And it's very slow.
2968	And it’s wrong.
2969	And it’s Yankee’s birthday.
2970	And it typically works.
2971	And it usually isn’t cheap.
2972	And it was all legal.
2973	And it was a real hot issue.
2974	And it was beautiful!
2975	And it was creepy.
2976	And it was extremely painful.
2977	And it was filmed!
2978	And it was for a great cause.
2979	And it was from a box.
2980	And it was in demand.
2981	And it was just a heartbreak.
2982	And it was just talent.
2983	And it was my story.
2984	And it was nice.
2985	And it was nighttime.
2986	And it was not alone.
2987	And it was not replaced with anything.
2988	And it wasn't all terrible.
2989	And it wasn’t protected behind a case.
2990	And, it was quiet.
2991	And it was really hard.
2992	And it was there in deed.
2993	And it was white.
2994	And it was with the same greyhound.
2995	And it was wonderful!
2996	And it will backfire soon.
2997	And it will be an adventure.
2998	And it will not happen.
2999	And it will not stop.
3000	And it will yield the same results.
3001	And it won’t be pretty.
3002	And it won't be quick.
3003	And it won't be that few.
3004	And it won’t empty your wallet.
3005	And I’ve followed that advice.
3006	And I walked out of the room.
3007	And I was awesome!
3008	And I was consistent."
3009	And I was pretty proud of it.
3010	And I was the director!
3011	And I was very idealistic.
3012	And I will bring Kleenex.
3013	And I will never stop.
3014	And I will not do it.
3015	And I will say this.

3171	And she does not complain easily.
3172	And she doesn’t.
3173	And she experienced tremendous relief.
3174	And she has a car.
3175	And she has a concussion.
3176	And she hasn’t looked back.
3177	And she is a harmony machine.
3178	And she just wasn’t satisfied.
3179	And she liked to smoke.
3180	And she managed to smile always.
3181	And she needs your help.
3182	And she never did.
3183	And she never will.
3184	And she refuses to compromise.
3185	And she runs with her iPhone.
3186	And she's a hard worker.
3187	And she’s certainly not mistaken.
3188	And she's just wonderful.
3189	And she's not tired yet.
3190	And she vanishes in the spray.
3191	And she vowed to fight back.
3192	"And she was also frugal.
3193	And she was frightened.
3194	“And she was just laughing.
3195	And she was polite.
3196	And she would be accurate.
3197	And showing my music.
3198	And skulls in the window.
3199	And smart locals are upgrading.
3200	And so, a concept sprouted.
3201	And so an idea was hatched.
3202	And so began their non-romance.
3203	And so began the research.
3204	And so did his skill.
3205	And so did John.
3206	And so entertainingly written.
3207	And so goes life.
3208	And so I followed him.
3209	And so is the maintenance.
3210	And so is the monastic life.
3211	And some costs are purely domestic.
3212	And some Mainers are joining the cause.
3213	And something familiar.
3214	And sometimes it does!
3215	And sometimes they don’t win.
3216	And sometimes, they’re colorful.
3217	And sometimes, they’re truly magical.
3218	And sometimes well below.
3219	And so Monroe did.
3220	And soon they did.
3221	And so the conversation begins.
3222	And so the requiem continues.
3223	And so the speculation begins.
3224	And so the system..
3225	And so they did the deed.
3226	And so they do nothing.
3227	And so they have.
3228	And so they posed together.
3229	And so they're cautious.
3230	And so very disappointed.
3231	And so we were.
3232	And so, what’s the problem?
3233	And spacing can be controlled.
3234	And spend it he did.
3235	And staff matters.
3236	And start with darkness.
3237	And still help.
3238	And such cute things.
3239	And suddenly I was black.
3240	And suddenly she was gone.
3241	And Sumlin helped in the process.
3242	And support it they did.
3243	And surgery can trigger metastasis.
3244	And teaching of students.
3245	And technically I didn’t find it.
3246	And Testa isn't alone.
3247	And thanks for the entertainment!
3248	And thanks for the entertainment.
3249	And thank you, America.
3250	And that activity has been somewhat puzzling.
3251	And that begs an important question.
3252	And that buoys her hope.
3253	And that could raise a lot.
3254	And that counts for a lot.
3255	And that crisis is terrible by any measure.
3256	And that demands a certain number.
3257	And that gift is free!
3258	And that includes honey.
3259	And that information is now private?
3260	"And that is a dangerous combination.
3261	And that is a discussion for another day.
3262	And that is also inspiring."
3263	And that is also inspiring.“
3264	And that is a relevant factor.
3265	And that is a topic for another article.
3266	And that is just the problem.
3267	And that is just what Kangogo did.
3268	And that is just wrong.
3269	And that is my constant battle.
3270	And that is not the majority of America.
3271	And that isn't really clear.
3272	And that is pretty cool."
3273	And that is rather stressful.
3274	And that is really a pity.
3275	And that is really challenging.
3276	And that is the fundamental problem.
3277	"And that is the honest truth.
3278	And that is their right.
3279	And that is the proper way!
3280	And that is the real truth.
3281	And that last number is not a typo.
3282	And that likeness is love.
3283	And that love has lasted.
3284	And that never works.
3285	And that's a big bet.
3286	And that’s absolutely fine.
3287	And that’s absolutely great.
3288	And that's a fair question.
3289	And that’s all!
3290	And that's all before dinnertime.
3291	And that’s a lot.
3292	And that’s a lot of them.
3293	And that’s already started.
3294	And that’s an ideal situation.
3295	And that's an unpopular reality.
3296	And that’s a pretty small fraction.
3297	And that’s a real concern.”
3298	And that's a really important decision.
3299	And that's a real problem.
3300	And that’s a recognition by everyone.
3301	And that’s a wonderful suggestion.
3302	“And that’s beneficial.
3303	And that's called a happy ending!
3304	And that's certainly not hopeless.
3305	And that’s certainly not true.
3306	And that’s exactly the case on the Hi-Line.
3307	And that’s exactly what Spinelli accomplished.
3308	And that’s great news.
3309	And that should not be the case.
3310	And that’s how they left.
3311	And that's its charm.
3312	And that’s just for openers.
3313	And that's just Halloween.
3314	And that's just in the past week.
3315	And that’s just not good.
3316	And that's just one mega-property.
3317	And that's just on the front end.
3318	And that’s just regular push-ups!
3319	And that's just the beginning."
3320	And that’s just the effect of a picture.
3321	And that’s just the first page of food.
3322	And that’s just the point.
3323	And that’s just what Kennedy did.
3324	And that's just wrong."
3325	And that’s just wrong.
3326	And that’s just your own life.
3327	And that’s kind of cool!
3328	And that's my take.
3329	And that’s my totem.
3330	And, that's no accident.
3331	And that’s no easy task.
3332	And that's not an easy process.
3333	And that's not cool.
3334	And that's not even the final total.
3335	And that’s not it.
3336	And that's not nearly the full story.
3337	“And that’s not necessarily surprising.
3338	And that’s not only narcotics.
3339	And that's not the sole purpose of that court.
3340	And that's OK by me.
3341	And that’s OK with him.
3342	And that’s only an excerpt.
3343	And that’s only a partial schedule.
3344	"And that's only natural.
3345	And that’s only the first level!
3346	And that's our real strength.
3347	And that’s pretty exciting.”
3348	And that’s probably OK.
3349	And that’s really great.
3350	And that's really the genesis of YSET.
3351	And that's really the issue.
3352	And that's serious!"
3353	And that's simply extraordinary.
3354	And that's still an ongoing process.
3355	And that starts with a mindset.
3356	And that’s the barb for Forrest.
3357	And that’s the basis of storytelling.
3358	And that’s the beauty of it.
3359	And that’s the beginning of wisdom.
3360	And that’s the good part of their staff.
3361	And that's the good stuff.
3362	And that’s the kiss of death.
3363	And that’s the point of contention.
3364	And that's the real problem.
3365	And that's the real problem here.
3366	And that’s the regular fare.
3367	And that’s the right answer.
3368	And that’s the story of the curry cult.
3369	And that’s the trouble.”
3370	And that story`s ahead.
3371	And, that's true.
3372	And that’s true too.
3373	And that sums up the conversation.
3374	And that’s what I meant.
3375	And that’s what Paige did.
3376	And that’s what Peck did.
3377	And that's what we decide.
3378	And that’s when he decided.
3379	And that’s when it ended.
3380	And that’s where it changed.
3381	And that's where the fear starts.
3382	And that’s where the music began.
3383	And that’s where things get dicey.
3384	“And that’s wrong.
3385	And that trend is on the rise.
3386	And that was a big concern.
3387	And that was a big event.
3388	And that was a purposeful choice.
3389	And that was a real problem.
3390	And that was a single photograph!
3391	And that was at the 48-yard line.
3392	And that was just over the summer.
3393	And that was just the aroma!
3394	And that was just the food.
3395	And that was no safe journey.
3396	And that wasn't easy.
3397	And that wasn't the first time!
3398	And that wasn't the intent of the question.
3399	And that was really hard.
3400	And that was smart.
3401	And that was tame.
3402	And that was the deal.
3403	And that was the entire obituary.
3404	And that was the genesis of this bill.
3405	And that was the main focus.
3406	And that was the plan.
3407	And that was the start.
3408	And that was the trigger.
3409	And that was well understood.
3410	And that would be a major development.
3411	And the alternative feels terrible.
3412	And the answer is pretty simple.
3413	And the appearance of a coverup is certainly damaging.
3414	And the art part?
3415	And the background.
3416	And the battle is ongoing.
3417	And the better manager?
3418	And the bills have serious consequences.
3419	And the boys began to laugh.
3420	And the cable company’s Internet modem.
3421	And the cars were awful.
3422	And the charade will continue.
3423	And the cheese on that pizza?
3424	And the child did live.
3425	And the combination makes sense.
3426	And the concerns are many.
3427	And the consequences are serious.
3428	And the crowd always goes wild.
3429	And the damage is only growing.
3430	And the damage might not be done.
3431	And the deals were extra-sweet.
3432	And the deep texture of the film!
3433	And the documents hold names.
3434	And the excitement is not over.
3435	And the festivities are over.
3436	And the food is hot.
3437	And the food is incredible.
3438	And the food is wonderful."
3439	And the fun doesn’t stop with the food.
3440	And the future is indeed eternal.
3441	And the games are usually close.
3442	And the games were good.
3443	And the goals started coming.
3444	And the good must win.
3445	And the great food is no exaggeration.
3446	And the growth is continuing.
3447	“And the growth is healthy.
3448	And the guns are everywhere.
3449	And the hangar steak is exactly medium-rare.
3450	And the hour is late.
3451	And the ingredients.
3452	And the interest appears to be mutual.
3453	And the Internet is helpful.
3454	And their favorite restaurants.

3459	And the kids sing it!
3460	And the lack of power steering?
3461	And the law depends on the state.
3462	And the link is in the article.
3463	And the lunch wasn’t bad either.
3464	And the mechanism is always the same.
3465	And the memories!
3466	And the menu has changed.
3467	And the movie proves that.
3468	And the mushroom cloud ate the dead.
3469	And the music reflects that.
3470	And the name was an appropriate tribute.
3471	And then check again.
3472	And the need is clear.”
3473	“And the neighborhood is terrific.

3479	And then I got online.
3480	And then I met another man.
3481	And then I stomped the mouse.

3488	And then she falls.
3489	And then the baby was gone.
3490	And then the doctor showed up.
3491	And then the pay.
3492	And then there are additional considerations.

3501	And then there's the character of the person.
3502	And then there’s the darkness in the morning.
3503	And then there’s the middle ground.
3504	And then there’s the problem of implementation.
3505	And then there’s the truth.
3506	And then there was a legal snag.
3507	And then there was that opaque tribute.
3508	And then there was the crazy programming.
3509	And then there was the inevitable drop.
3510	And then there was the Jewish question.
3511	And then the second half began.
3512	And then the serious talking started.
3513	And then the third set happened.
3514	And then they can carry on the model.
3515	And then they did change.
3516	And then they heard it.
3517	And then we have a bridal specialist.
3518	And then we said goodbye.
3519	And then you accept it.
3520	And then you grow old.
3521	And then you hit tragedy.
3522	And the occasional mystery bug.
3523	And the old friend found again?
3524	And the open implementation is still an open question.
3525	And the pain goes even deeper.
3526	And the pair shared a hearty handshake.
3527	And the pattern can be modified.
3528	And the piano still anchors the stage.
3529	And the point is not expressed by anyone.
3530	And the politicians know that.
3531	And the poor die without mercy.
3532	And the potential market is vast.
3533	And the pressure intensified.
3534	And the pressure is definitely on.
3535	And the prices can vary dramatically.
3536	And the probate lawyer.
3537	And the PTO Citizenship Award.
3538	And the public knows the difference.
3539	And the question of patriotism is very disturbing.
3540	And the rain came down.
3541	And there are no immoderate politicians.
3542	And there are other outdoor activities.

3546	And there is a reason behind this.
3547	And there is a wide selection.
3548	And there is no adult supervision.

66110	That part was postponed until another retreat in April.
66111	That part will happen.
66112	That part will start next month.
66113	That part won..

66117	That pay would be retroactive.
66118	That PD spokesperson was Mary Harney.
66119	That percentage decreased to 14.8 in 2013-14.
66120	That percentage goes directly to that organization.
66121	That perception is supported by data in many cases.
66122	That perception is wrong.
66123	That period closed last week.
66124	That permission needed to come from the insurance company.
66125	That person checked out.

66180	That question is currently hard to answer.
66181	That question is none of her business!
66182	That question is still pending in Summit County.
66183	That question needs no further study.
66184	That question now seems answered.
66185	That question should be asked.
66186	That question went unanswered.
66187	That rationale is flawed.
66188	That really affected him.
66189	That really clicked for me.
66190	That really helps me.
66191	That really isn’t his style.
66192	That really scares me.

66198	That rejection toughened my skin.
66199	That relationship broke apart in the mid-1970s.

66210	That request was approved by council.
66211	That request was carried unanimously.
66212	That requires an understanding of the local power structure.

66214	That requires basic intelligence work.
66215	That research is continuing today.
66216	That resident has been accounted for.
66217	That response is unacceptable.
66218	That response quickly went viral.
66219	That right has already been earned.
66220	That right is reserved for the legislature.
66221	That rightly affirmed his culpability.
66222	That right was removed by land councils.
66223	That road is used heavily.

66239	That’s a 5% gain over last year.
66240	That's a $9 million item.
66241	That's a big, big drop.
66242	“That’s a big deal for a major company.
66243	That's a big disadvantage for Trump.
66244	That's a big momentum boost.
66245	That’s a big name for a little baby.
66246	That's a big part of their businesses.
66247	That's a big pill to swallow.'
66248	That's a big shake up.
66249	That’s a big team goal.
66250	That’s a big temperature drop.
66251	That’s a bit harder.
66252	That's a bit of an anomaly.

66264	That's above my pay grade.
66265	That's a busy man, indeed.
66266	That’s accurate really!
66267	That’s a central concept of financial life planning.
66268	That's a challenge.
66269	That's a circus show climax.
66270	That’s a constant battle for us now.
66271	That’s a cool aspect of our campus.
66272	That’s a cool million.
66273	That's a courageous goal to set.
66274	That’s a credit to him.
66275	That's a credit to their offense.
66276	“That’s a critical component in our culture.
66277	That's actually been a benefit.
66278	That’s actually my background.
66279	That's a dangerous and selfish game.
66280	That's a decision for the Eritrean Government.
66281	That's a discussion for another time.
66282	That’s a distinction we don’t need.
66283	That’s a distinctive quality in this marketplace.”
66284	That's adoration in action!
66285	That’s a fabulous shot of Jane.
66286	That’s a fact of life in national parks.
66287	"That's a fair bit of crack," he said.
66288	That’s a frank look at hot dogs!
66289	That's a freight train up the poop-chute.
66290	That’s a frightening use of power.
66291	That's a general cake principle?
66292	That's a good guess, Rasp.
66293	"That's a good hockey team.
66294	That’s a good message of solidarity.
66295	That’s a good note to end on.
66296	That’s a good place to start from.”
66297	That's a good thing," she said.
66298	That’s a great accomplishment this year.
66299	“That’s a great idea to invite the public.
66300	That’s a great inning by him.”
66301	That's a great night for him."
66302	“That’s a great piece of history.
66303	That’s a great step from the Congress Party.
66304	That’s a great straight arm in the photo.
66305	“That’s a great way to put it.
66306	"That's a guarantee!"
66307	That's a hangover cure.
66308	That's a health and safety issue.
66309	"That's a heck of a football team.
66310	That's a hell of a good start.
66311	That’s a huge incentive for the boys.”
66312	“That’s a lifetime in this business.“
66313	That's a little.
66314	That’s a little bit unusual.
66315	That’s a little extra help.
66316	That’s all been really helpful.”
66317	That's all for this week.
66318	That’s all I could do.
66319	That's all I'm saying."
66320	That's all I need.
66321	That's all I said.
66322	That’s all it is.
66323	That’s all I’ve ever done.
66324	That's all of our new additions.
66325	"That's all part of state law.
66326	That’s all the information you need.
66327	That’s all very exciting.
66328	That's all we can promise.
66329	That's almost 11 deaths every day.
66330	That's almost a 10 percent improvement!
66331	That’s almost double the national average.
66332	That’s a long time,” said Sherzer.
66333	That’s a long time, you know.
66334	That's a lot of copy and paste.
66335	That’s a lot of millions!
66336	That’s a lot of projects to oversee.
66337	That's a lot of sparkles.
66338	That's a lot of talking.
66339	That's a lot of Warm Biz.
66340	That's a lot of wins.
66341	That’s a lot to absorb.
66342	That's already in the pilot stage.
66343	"That's already very clear.
66344	That's also a natural part of life.
66345	That's also just fine too.
66346	That's also not unusual for a long-term incumbent.
66347	That’s also part of the reconciliation process.
66348	That’s also their plan.
66349	That’s also true of Google.
66350	That’s always a dead giveaway of age.
66351	That’s always good advice in any endeavor.
66352	That’s always people’s favorite.
66353	"That's always the goal."
66354	That’s always the response.”
66355	That's a major difference right there.
66356	That’s a marked change from before.
66357	That’s America today.
66358	That's an accomplishment in my mind!
66359	That’s an additional license fee.
66360	That's an amazing deal for a five-star restaurant.
66361	That’s an amazing sentence to write.
66362	That's an annual increase of 13%.
66363	That's an awful lot of devils.
66364	That sandwich requires a nap."
66365	That's an easy one.
66366	That’s an easy wish for me to make.
66367	That’s an emotional decision and totally understandable.
66368	That’s an expectation of the college as professional behaviour.
66369	That's an expense.
66370	That's an ice-breaker at a party.
66371	That’s a nice cause for the students.
66372	That's an impressive list of challenges and triumphs.
66373	That's an interesting inversion of priorities.
66374	That's an issue."
66375	That's an opportunity.
66376	That's another 1.4% increase.
66377	“That’s another great thing about these rugs.
66378	That’s another thing between partners.
66379	That's an unacceptable level of pain and suffering.
66380	That's any hacker's wet-dream.
66381	That's anyone's guess.
66382	That’s a pretty large trust gap.
66383	That's a pretty reasonable connection to make.
66384	“That’s a pretty unprecedented lucky streak,” he said.
66385	That's April 30, 2009.
66386	That’s April’s story line.
66387	That's a radical thought, indeed.
66388	That's a rare combination of virtues.
66389	That's a real cost saver!
66390	That’s a real game changer.
66391	That's a real life example.
66392	That's a really hard thing to say.
66393	“That’s a really local business.”
66394	“That’s a record for me.
66395	That's a rough drive up there.
66396	That's around 22 acres.
66397	That’s a serious and potentially fatal problem.
66398	That’s a serious and unusual effort.
66399	That's a small taste of the entree.
66400	“That’s a statement of some kind.
66401	That’s a strong position against Dr. Minnis.
66402	That’s a sure way to clear the room.
66403	That’s a telling statement.
66404	That's a total of 6,797 toys!
66405	That’s a tough and complicated question.
66406	"That's a trailer park thing.
66407	That's a useful breakdown of things.
66408	That’s a very gray area question.”
66409	That’s a very low standard in that context.”
66410	That's a very narrow-minded view of the world.
66411	“That’s a very noir thing.
66412	That’s a warning, man.
66413	That’s a week too long.
66414	That's a whole lot of Hershey.
66415	That’s a whole ’nother deal.
66416	That's a whole nother story.
66417	That's a whole other can of worms.
66418	That’s a wonderful place,” said Casper.
66419	That says a lot about our institution.
66420	That says pretty much everything.
66421	That's bad for Alaska.
66422	That's bad in two ways.
66423	That's bad news for Canada.
66424	That’s basically how I argue.
66425	That's basically online entitlement.
66426	That's basically what the song says.
66427	That’s because he doesn’t talk.
66428	That's because they're natural.
66429	That’s been acknowledged now.
66430	That’s been an issue here.
66431	That’s been my observation.
66432	That’s been obvious for a while.
66433	That’s been put on hold.
66434	That’s been the cause of the problem.
66435	That's been the key.
66436	That's before taxes.
66437	That's before the campaign.
66438	That’s being expanded.
66439	That’s below the belt!
66440	That's better for everybody.
66441	That's blackmail to me.
66442	That's Bush for you.
66443	That’s California law.
66444	That’s called an empty apology.
66445	That's called consistency.
66446	That's called growth.
66447	That’s called the value structure.
66448	That's called unfettered capitalism.
66449	That scared a lot of people.
66450	That's causing a fuss.
66451	That scenario is very likely to happen.
66452	"That's certainly an option.
66453	That’s certainly helped us.
66454	That’s certainly helping to add value.
66455	That's changed, however.
66456	That scholarship was celebrated with a reception at city hall.
66457	That's Christy's approach.
66458	That’s clearly my own fault.
66459	That’s closer than Miami.
66460	That's cold, Darnell.
66461	That's cold for Costa Ricans.
66462	That's cold, y'all.
66463	That's come from the top.
66464	That's coming from the federal government.
66465	That’s common for federal agencies.
66466	That's concerning.
66467	"That's correct!
66468	That's crazy man.
66469	That’s crazy to me.
66470	That's debatable, actually.
66471	That's definitely changed.
66472	That's demoralizing stuff for a defender.
66473	That’s difficult to go coach in that position.
66474	"That's double the national average.
66475	That’s down from 15.6 percent in 2012.
66476	That’s down from 24.6 percent in 2014.

66478	That’s down three years in a row.
66479	That seat’s taken.
66480	That section of road really needs some work.
66481	That section would have several condominiums.
66482	That’s education-tourism for you.
66483	That seemed by design.
66484	That seemed like a longshot.
66485	That seems easy enough.
66486	That seems inconsistent.
66487	That seems like a win for everyone.
66488	That seems pretty profitable to me.
66489	That seems reasonable and prudent.
66490	That seems unlikely.
66491	That's enough from Slate's loon-du-jour.

66493	That sentiment was echoed by Geller.
66494	That sentiment was echoed by Rep. Janice Hahn, D-San Pedro.

66504	That's extra from the cost of the trip.
66505	That’s extremely high praise.”
66506	That’s fairly typical for the spring market.
66507	That's fair right?
66508	That's far from a life-altering revelation.
66509	That's fatal to his career.
66510	That's fine by us.
66511	“That’s fine,” she told him.
66512	That’s fine with Bynum.

66532	That’s government for you!
66533	That’s great for our community.”
66534	That's great news for fantasy owners.
66535	That's half the show.
66536	That's Hall of Fame stuff.
66537	That shaped him.
66538	That’s happening all over the country.
66539	"That's happiness."
66540	That’s hardly the basis for a productivity boom.
66541	That's hard to dispute.
66542	That's hard to explain there.
66543	That’s hard to shake off.
66544	That’s headed for a commission vote.
66545	That’s heartening to me.
66546	“That’s helped us on the boards.
66547	That’s her first piece of advice.
66548	That's her home turf.”
66549	That’s her personality.
66550	“That’s high school football.
66551	That's his attitude still.
66552	That's his explanation.
66553	That's his first mistake.
66554	That’s his game at this point.”
66555	That's his goal.
66556	"That's his little buddy."
66557	That's his obligation.
66558	That's his passion.
66559	That’s his personal opinion.
66560	That's his prerogative.
66561	That's his right as the boss.
66562	That shit is dangerous.
66563	That shit is stupid.
66564	That shot was blocked.
66565	That should be it!
66566	That should be our mission.”
66567	That should be the end of the matter.
66568	That should be the exact opposite of their job.
66569	That should be your final option.
66570	That should bring us some comfort.
66571	That should freshen up the game.
66572	That should give us all hope.
66573	That should have been the final straw.
66574	That should help a lot."
66575	That should help him immensely.
66576	That should make a final decision.
66577	That shouldn't come as a surprise.
66578	That shouldn't surprise anybody.
66579	That should say nationwide.
66580	That should soothe anybody's sole.
66581	That's how apathetic they are.
66582	That's how budgets are done.
66583	That's how corruption flourishes.
66584	That's how Diamond Dreams was born.
66585	That showed a certain evolution of the band.
66586	That's how God works.
66587	That's how he explained it."
66588	That’s how he felt about Trump.
66589	That's how he learned the news.
66590	“That’s how I hear them.
66591	That’s how I met Dallas.
66592	That's how important it was.
66593	"That's how I roll."
66594	That's how ISIS grew.
66595	That's how I take it.
66596	That's how it all works.
66597	That’s how rich I was!
66598	That’s how she approaches everything.
66599	That’s how she looked.”
66600	That’s how the ad read.
66601	That’s how the economy grows.
66602	That's how the half will end.
66603	That's how the project began.
66604	“That’s how they choose a place.
66605	That’s how unpopular he was!
66606	That’s how we control them.
66607	“That’s how we felt.
66608	That’s how we’re living.
66609	That's how you change things.
66610	That's how you diversify an economy."
66611	“That’s huge for us.
66612	That's hugely important to them.
66613	That’s ice cold.
66614	That’s identification enough.
66615	That's immature and inappropriate behavior.
66616	That simple move would solve a lot of problems.
66617	That’s impressive enough.
66618	That’s impressive, indeed.
66619	“That’s incredibly exciting for them,” Coolong-Chaffin said.
66620	That's inspiration to me.
66621	That's interesting behaviour.
66622	That’s interesting, too.
66623	That's it, Ken.
66624	That situation has changed dramatically.
66625	That situation is a large population of unwanted animals.
66626	That situation must end.
66627	That's Jason Clay from World Wildlife.
66628	That’s Jon Hill’s job description.
66629	That's JR East only.
66630	That's just a no-no.”
66631	That’s just a side note.
66632	That's just a simple matter of respect.
66633	That’s just as important.
66634	That's just basic journalism.
66635	That’s just children.
66636	That's just common sense."
66637	That's just completely wrong.
66638	That's just crazy talk!
66639	That’s just his style.”
66640	That’s just history.
66641	That's just history,” he said.
66642	That's just how it happens.
66643	That's just how I think.
66644	That's just lagniappe.
66645	That’s just like Dad.
66646	That’s just my memory.
66647	That’s just my mentality.”
66648	That's just my opinion though.
66649	“That’s just my son.
66650	That's just not possible."
66651	That’s just not sustainable."
66652	“That’s just not the American way.
66653	That’s just one boat.
66654	That’s just one of the consequences.
66655	“That’s just one window on a school.
66656	That's just right.
66657	That’s just scratching the surface.
66658	That's just shameful for society.
66659	That's just South Beach style.
66660	That’s just stupid, he said.
66661	That's just talent overkill.
66662	That’s just the nature of the sport.
66663	That’s just the tip of the iceberg.
66664	That’s just the way I feel.
66665	That's just trolling!
66666	That’s just what I do.
66667	That’s just what we want.
66668	That skill won the event for the team.
66669	That’s kind of an easy decision.
66670	That’s kind of fun.
66671	That’s kind of my point.
66672	“That’s kind of the beauty of the trail.
66673	That’s less than 5 percent!
66674	That's life on the road.
66675	“That’s like playing with a bomb.
66676	That’s like shift work.
66677	“That’s like winning the lottery.”
66678	That’s loads of time.
66679	That’s long been the law of the land.
66680	That's longer than communism.
66681	That's made by council.
66682	That’s made it a lot of fun.
66683	“That’s Mallie Jo’s power wall.
66684	That’s merely a statement of fact.
66685	That's missing right now."
66686	That's more of a story.
66687	That’s mostly a question of tactics.
66688	That’s mostly what we get to do.
66689	That’s Mr. Pereda’s business.
66690	“That’s my best night.
66691	That's my brothers.
66692	That's my choice.
66693	That’s my comment to them.
66694	That’s my concern with this team.”
66695	That’s my connection with the Jewish community.
66696	That's my debate prep."
66697	That’s my element.
66698	"That's my fault.
66699	That's my favorite feeling in the world.
66700	That’s my favorite movie of all time.
66701	That’s my first lining.
66702	That’s my first point.
66703	“That’s my first priority.”
66704	That's my fondest memory.
66705	"That's my future goal."
66706	That’s my goal here.
66707	That’s my greatest hope.
66708	“That’s my guy.
66709	That's my issue with unions.
66710	That’s my job, right?
66711	“That’s my juice.
66712	"That's my main concern.
66713	“That’s my mom’s recipe,” Jason said.
66714	That's my name, Walter Smith.
66715	"That's my nature.
66716	That’s my only plan.”
66717	That's my opinion.
66718	That's my personal opinion."
66719	That’s my personal opinion,” Ejercito added.
66720	That’s my pipe dream.
66721	That’s my place of work.
66722	That's my pledge."
66723	That's my point, sir.
66724	That’s my problem with Gorbachev.
66725	“That’s my quality.
66726	"That's my question."
66727	"That's my rehearsal.
66728	"That's my revenge."
66729	That's my shameless plug.
66730	That’s my space!
66731	That's my territory.
66732	That's my whole objective.
66733	That’s my wife for you.
66734	That's neither apathy nor resignation.
66735	That's never an easy question to answer.
66736	That’s never been a good idea.
66737	That’s never happened in our program’s history.
66738	That's news to me.
66739	That's nice Mike.
66740	That’s no dog at all!
66741	That’s no easy feat in pro football.
66742	That's no exaggeration.
66743	That’s normal prevailing wind.
66744	That’s not a bad thing to want.
66745	That's not a break for a family."
66746	That's not acceptable to me.
66747	That’s not a job, it’s an experience.
66748	That’s not allowed on public land.
66749	That's not a lot of fun.
66750	That’s not an estimate or a projection.
66751	That’s not an excuse, though.
66752	"That's not an independent statement.
66753	That’s not anybody’s entire life.
66754	That’s not a problem with a referendum.
66755	That’s not as esoteric as it might sound.
66756	That's not a slam on North Dakota.
66757	"That's not a traditional dress."
66758	That's not a very accurate statement.
66759	That's not bad at all.
66760	That’s not been my experience.
66761	That’s not bliss, that’s blankness.
66762	That's not boasting.
66763	That's not bullying.
66764	That’s not clever at all.
66765	“That’s not common,” Gooding said Wednesday.
66766	That’s not controversial and it’s not anecdotal.
66767	That's not cutting it.
66768	That’s not demand.
66769	That's not entirely fair.
66770	That’s not exactly accurate.
66771	That's not fair to anyone.
66772	“That’s not going to cut it.
66773	That’s not going to happen.
66774	That’s not going to happen this time.”
66775	"That's not good at all.
66776	"That's not good enough.
66777	That's not good judgment."
66778	"That's not government's role.
66779	“That’s not happening.
66780	That's not happening now.
66781	That's not happening this time.
66782	That’s not hard at all.
66783	That’s not healthy either.
66784	“That’s not helpful for unity.
66785	That's not his intention.
66786	That’s not in the pursuit of happiness.
66787	That’s not just a minor change.
66788	That’s not just bend-but-don’t-break.
66789	That’s not just coach talk.
66790	That’s not just me.
66791	That’s not just on the line.
66792	That's not likely to happen anymore.
66793	That's not my bag.
66794	That's not my life.
66795	That's not necessarily the case.
66796	That’s not only outrageous.
66797	“That’s not on the agenda,” McDonald said.
66798	"That's not our goal."
66799	That’s not our mission.”
66800	That's not our position.
66801	That’s not really a good formula."
66802	That's not really liberalization.
66803	That’s not really news.
66804	That's not really secure.
66805	That's not remotely likely.
66806	That's not right!"
66807	That’s not right in my book.
66808	That’s not rocket science.
66809	That's not so bad.'
66810	That's not so good for an incumbent president.
66811	That's not so sexy.
66812	That’s not the case at La Gloria.
66813	That's not the case for this Nevada family.
66814	That's not the case,” she said.
66815	That’s not the case with these plans.
66816	That’s not the Downey way.
66817	That’s not the end of the matter.
66818	“That’s not their primary focus.
66819	That's not their style.
66820	That’s not the norm.”
66821	That's not the only Orwellian touch in this measure.
66822	That's not the only problem either.
66823	That’s not the problem at all.
66824	That's not the way I think.
66825	That’s not the way it works!
66826	That's not the way the law works.
66827	That’s not thinking.
66828	That's not too hard to take.
66829	That s not true.
66830	That’s not true at all!
66831	That’s not true at every department.
66832	That's not unusual, right?
66833	That’s not user friendly.
66834	That’s not usual for comics.
66835	“That’s not very sexy.”
66836	That's not viable as well.
66837	That’s not what I’m thinking about.
66838	That's not what that word means.
66839	That’s not what we did.
66840	That's not what we need to do.
66841	That's not who he is."
66842	That's not with exhibits.
66843	That's not within our mandate.
66844	"That's not zero tolerance.
66845	That's obviously not the case.
66846	That society continues to exist today.
66847	“That’s often the case.
66848	That someone in Brandon's life.
66849	That someone is Jesus Christ.
66850	That someone was Tre’Von Jackson.
66851	That something doesn’t exist.
66852	That something remains a mystery until the very end.
66853	That’s on a national and local level.
66854	That's one factor.
66855	That's one hungry hound!
66856	That's one of the busiest intersections in town.
66857	That’s on everything.
66858	That's only 10 quarts of syrup.
66859	That’s only 14 years down the line.
66860	That’s on our minds.
66861	That’s on our shoulders.”
66862	That's on the coaching.
66863	That's on the microscopic level.
66864	That sort of speculation is flabby writing.
66865	That sounded like the cellar.
66866	That sounded perfect to me.
66867	"That sound inspired me.
66868	That sounds fascinating.
66869	That sounds gorgeous.
66870	That sounds great.”
66871	That sounds heavy, right?
66872	That sounds like a good plan.
66873	That sounds like an awful lot.
66874	That sounds like a semi-permanent occupation.
66875	That sounds pretty economic to me.
66876	That sounds tough."
66877	That sounds very vicious to me.
66878	That's our advice for this weekend.
66879	“That’s our favourite team.”
66880	That's our goal for the week."
66881	“That’s our growth plan.
66882	That's our intention.
66883	That's our kind of party.
66884	That's our No. 1 priority.
66885	That’s our North Star.
66886	“That’s our point of emphasis.
66887	“That’s our present goal.”
66888	That's our primary goal.
66889	That’s our privilege and our responsibility.

66891	That's our proposal.
66892	That's our report.
66893	That’s our ultimate goal,” he said.
66894	That's our whole goal."
66895	“That’s part of building trust.
66896	That's part of it.
66897	That's part of our position.
66898	That’s part of the compromises.
66899	"That's part of the delay."
66900	That's part of the experience, too.
66901	“That’s part of the play.
66902	That’s part of the problem.”
66903	“That’s part of the process.
66904	That’s part of the story.
66905	That’s part of your job.
66906	That's peer pressure.
66907	That’s Perimeter, that’s downtown.
66908	That’s personal for me.
66909	"That's phenomenal for us," he said.
66910	That spin-off was dubbed Agilent.
66911	"That's possible.
66912	"That's powerful.
66913	That’s pretty big for these horses.
66914	That’s pretty close to today.
66915	That’s pretty cool for the rats.
66916	That’s pretty cool, too.
66917	"That's pretty damn good."
66918	That's pretty darn good."
66919	That's pretty doggone disruptive.
66920	“That’s pretty good for us.
66921	That’s pretty good for us.”
66922	That’s pretty good stuff.
66923	"That's pretty much the bottom line.
66924	That's pretty solid defense.
66925	That's probably far from it.
66926	That's probably for the best.
66927	That’s probably my biggest challenge.
66928	"That's probably the big difference.
66929	That's probably way underestimated.
66930	That's progress.
66931	That's protecting the football.
66932	That's provided through a full service partnership.
66933	That squad posted a winning time of 3:39.1.
66934	That's quite a bit of a jump!
66935	That's quite a payback.
66936	That's quite confronting for those people.
66937	That’s quite far down south!
66938	That's quite ok.
66939	That’s really fast.
66940	“That’s really going to help us.”
66941	That's really good to see."
66942	That's really key for us.
66943	That’s really not a dumb question.
66944	That’s really our approach.
66945	That's really pretty simple.
66946	“That’s really the bottom line for me.
66947	That's really the only question mark for this team.
66948	That’s really the whole idea of it.
66949	That's real vision and leadership.
66950	That’s right, a song.
66951	That's right, friends.
66952	That's right, Guillermone.
66953	That's right, ice fish.
66954	That's right, Jackson.
66955	That's right, Michael.
66956	That’s right, Slow Food.
66957	That's roughly a 50 percent increase.
66958	That’s Santa peeking over the horizon.
66959	That’s sarcasm by the way.
66960	That’s self-serving speculation at best.
66961	That’s simple common sense.
66962	"That's simply not true."
66963	That’s smart spending.
66964	That’s so cool, right?
66965	That’s some boring stuff now.”
66966	That's some Sick Out.
66967	That's something to admire.
66968	That’s something to build on.
66969	"That's some validation.
66970	That's so nineties.
66971	That's sort of a red herring argument.
66972	That’s sort of the status.
66973	That’s still not much.”
66974	"That's still the key ingredient.
66975	“That’s still true today.”
66976	That standard was thrown out the window in Ghomeshi’s case.
66977	That started the adventure.
66978	That starts with CEO Tim Rice.
66979	That statement has turned the event into a political crisis.
66980	That statement is almost laughable.
66981	That statement is false.
66982	That station is now known as Three D Radio.
66983	That statistic prompted the action.
66984	That's technically not correct.
66985	That’s terrifying to me.
66986	That’s thanks to water.
66987	That's the advice..
66988	That’s the America I know.
66989	That's the approach I want to adopt.
66990	That’s the basic bargain of America.
66991	That’s the beauty of the college game.
66992	That’s the beauty of the tournament.
66993	“That's the beauty of the training camp,” McGill said.
66994	That's the beauty of this year."
66995	That’s the beneficial part of it.”
66996	That's the best line?

66998	“That’s the best part about this job.”
66999	"That's the best thing in the world."
67000	That’s the best you can do?
67001	That’s the biggest dream.
67002	That's the big picture answer.
67003	That’s the brain.
67004	That's the brilliance of Tarantino.
67005	That’s the case again this year.
67006	That’s the case here.
